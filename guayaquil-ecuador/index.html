      The largest city in Ecuador, Guayaquil is a busy river and seaport city in the Costa Region. It is generally considered to be the economic capital of Ecuador and the thriving entrepreneurial spirit of its people give evidence to this fact. Not only is this city located on the coast, but it is also the center of activity for the Lower Guayas Basin – a fertile valley that has a large agricultural yield. Guayaquil is also the perfect place to start your Ecuadorian adventures as it allows for easy travel through the rest of the country.
