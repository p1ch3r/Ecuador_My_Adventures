    Quito is the second largest and populous city with a population of about 1,607,734 and capital of Pichincha Province. Quito was declared a city in 1541. The city served as an administrative town of Spain. Today the city is recognized as an important historical center. Quito is divided into three regions that are separated by hills. The northern part is a modern region with modern buildings, shopping centers, financial institutions, and working-class residences, the central region houses the old colonial city and the southern region has industrial and residential units.
